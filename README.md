# Smart-Inhaler-Device

Asthma is a serious inflammatory disorder affecting millions of people worldwide. Thuvia Systems has recently
been researching the way patients consume their inhaler medication. The goal is to develop a smart medical
inhaler that enhances asthma medication adherence. Creating a smart device will help patients properly use the
inhaler and allow integration with a smart phone applications. This device will collect data on when, where, and
how well the patient uses the device. This design is user friendly, utilizing audio queues and visual feedback.
The smart inhaler will be created with a computer development board, equipped with multiple sensors and a
debugging system. This product will re-imagine and re-design a crude prototype of the inhaler that was
previously developed. This product will supply state-of-the-art embedded computer development boards,
debugging systems, sensors, and 3D printing materials. The device will incorporate NOx sensors and digital
pressure sensors to capture patient data that interfaces with Bluetooth Low Energy.The smart inhaler will be
integrated with functions that allow for varied device operation through an inhalation and exhalation. There will
be specific action functions, which will protect the flow sensing device, reducing the possibility of damaging
the flow sensing device components. In the case that the flow sensor becomes fouled from regular and/or
incorrect usage, the flow sensing device should be easily replaceable. In addition, the device should give
positive visual/audio feedback to the user for proper device operation. Finally, the students will develop a power
management system. Overall, the device should collect inspiratory flow and NOx data, store it, then transfer it
to a collection system through wireless interfacing. In the end, students will have learned how to make real
products “smart”.
